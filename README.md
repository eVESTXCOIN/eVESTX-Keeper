# Keeper Wallet
eVESTX Keeper Wallet is an extension that allows users to securely interact with web services enabled for both eVESTX chains from within the Chrome browser.

Seed phrases and private keys are encrypted and stored within the extension and cannot be accessed by dApps and online services, ensuring that users' funds are always safe from hackers and malicious websites. Completing a transaction does not require entering confidential information.

VestX Keeper Wallet is designed for convenience, so users can sign transactions to the mainchain and sidechain with just a few clicks. Users can create multiple wallets and switch between them easily. And if a user forgets the account password, it can be recovered from the opening phrase.
